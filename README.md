## Setup

Create a webhook to post to Teams. The Webhook needs to be of the PowerAutomate type, not the deprecated Incoming Webhook type. Currently this is done either through the 'workflows' app in Teams, or via [PowerAutomate](https://powerautomate.com). 

Once that's ready, create an HTTP Connection in Airflow with the Webhook URL. 

* Conn Type: HTTP
* Host: The URL without the https://
* Schema: https

Finally, copy the [ms_teams_power_automate_webhook_operator.py](./ms_teams_powerautomate_webhook_operator.py) file into your Airflow dags folder and `import` it in your DAG code.

## Usage

The usage can be very basic from just a message, to a full card with header, subtitle, body, facts, and a button. There are some style options too. 

A very basic message:

```python
 op1 = MSTeamsPowerAutomateWebhookOperator(
        task_id="send_to_teams",
        http_conn_id="msteams_webhook_url",
        body_message="DAG **lorem_ipsum** has completed successfully in **localhost**",
    )
```

Add a button:
    
```python
op1 = MSTeamsPowerAutomateWebhookOperator(
        task_id="send_to_teams",
        http_conn_id="msteams_webhook_url",
        body_message="DAG **lorem_ipsum** has completed successfully in **localhost**",
        button_text="View Logs",
        button_url="https://example.com",
    )
```

Add a heading and subtitle:

```python
op1 = MSTeamsPowerAutomateWebhookOperator(
        task_id="send_to_teams",
        http_conn_id="msteams_webhook_url",
        heading_title="DAG **lorem_ipsum** has completed successfully",
        heading_subtitle="In **localhost**",
        body_message="DAG **lorem_ipsum** has completed successfully in **localhost**",
        button_text="View Logs",
        button_url="https://example.com",
    )
```

Add some colouring â€” header bar colour, subtle subtitle, body text colour, button colour:

```python
op1 = MSTeamsPowerAutomateWebhookOperator(
        task_id="send_to_teams",
        http_conn_id="msteams_webhook_url",
        header_bar_style="good",
        heading_title="DAG **lorem_ipsum** has completed successfully",
        heading_subtitle="In **localhost**",
        heading_subtitle_subtle=False,
        body_message="DAG **lorem_ipsum** has completed successfully in **localhost**",
        body_message_color_type="good",
        button_text="View Logs",
        button_url="https://example.com",
        button_style="positive",
    )
```

You can also look at [sample_dag.py](./sample_dag.py) for an example of how to use this operator in a DAG.

## The old incoming webhooks

This operator only works with the new PowerAutomate webhooks. The old incoming webhooks were deprecated in this [Teams announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/). It says they'll keep working until December 2025 but I expect much degradation in the service before then.  

The previous version of this operator that worked with the old incoming webhooks is in [the master-old-connectors branch](https://github.com/mendhak/Airflow-MS-Teams-Operator/tree/master-old-connectors). This operator is not a drop-in replacement for the old one, as there are too many differences.

## Testing this plugin locally for development

I've taken the docker compose yml from [here](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/docker-compose/index.html), with a few changes. Load examples is false and added an extra_hosts.

Run this to prepare the environment:

```
mkdir -p ./dags ./logs ./plugins ./config
echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)" > .env
docker compose up airflow-init
docker compose up
```

Then wait a bit, and open http://localhost:8080 with airflow:airflow. 

To create a connection quickly, use this CLI command

```
docker compose exec -it airflow-webserver airflow connections add 'msteams_webhook_url' --conn-json '{"conn_type": "http", "description": "", "host": "<url-goes-here-without https://>", "schema": "https", "login": "", "password": null, "port": null }'
```

Now run the sample_dag to see the operator in action. 

### Echoing requests

To troubleshoot the requests going out, use the included httpecho container which echoes the request to output.  
In Airflow connections, create an HTTP Connection to http://httpecho:8081 


```
docker compose exec -it airflow-webserver airflow connections add 'msteams_webhook_url' --conn-json '{"conn_type": "http", "description": "", "host": "httpecho:8081/a/b/c", "schema": "http", "login": "", "password": null, "port": null }'

docker compose logs -f httpecho
```

### Posting a card with curl

To manually post the sample card to a webhook URL, just for testing, use the included samplecard.json file.

```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @samplecard.json  "https://prod-11.westus.logic.azure.com:443/workflows/.............."
```
